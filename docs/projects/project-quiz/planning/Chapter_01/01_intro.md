# Quiz-Application

This application was created because of the idea that people can learn about the bible by also solving some quizzes.

The main idea is that questions can be answered on a phone or any other device and is checked. But to make it more interesting, we plan to apply a online gaming element, where people can play against each others. 

But this is not everything. The next idea is to implement a kind of storyline. This storyline explain for example a story of the bible in multiple steps. And on each step a user can also answer question made specific for this part of the story.

This is the first idea, other features might be added later.

This pages are organized based on the [Arc42 Documentation](https://arc42.org/overview).
It should help to understand our project better.
