# Starting My Quiz App Project

Today I'm embarking on a new development journey - creating a quiz application from scratch. This project will help me strengthen my programming skills while building something useful and interactive.

<!-- truncate -->

## Project Goals
- Create a quiz application for christians.
- Bring the bible nearer to the bible by letting them solving quizzes.
- Find out new things about the bible by enabling new knowledge about the word.
- Let friends test their knowledge agains each others.

## Initial Planning Phase

For the first phase, I'll focus on:

1. Defining the core features.
2. Selecting the right technology stack.
3. Setting up Github as my code base.
4. Create the basic project structure.

The idea is to document my journey and also announce new features which where implemented.
Stay tuned.
