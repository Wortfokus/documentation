# Explanation

Like every bigger project, we try to make a short research on our needed items to fulfill the wishes of our customer.
Since this page is maintained by the author and also created, he will make the first draft of the requirements and features, we want to implement.

It will first sum again what is planned to create in this project. Afterwards we have made a list with features we want to provide. On the page [requirements](requirements.mdx) we sampled a list with the found requirements, we have to fulfill in case we want to have a little bit of a success.

On the other page [architecture](architecture.md) we have written a small overview of the components we will implement. Further ideas about better technologies are welcomed.

# Summary

We want to create an application with mainly three features. First of all you are able to solve quizzes, which are based on the bible. Next to it, we will have the possibility to play the same game against friends.

In the end we will provide a story-line. This is a story of for example a bible character like Moses and it will have questions, to check if you learned something.


# Features

1. Play games on your own
2. Play against your friends
3. Storytime

Further features can be applied in a later stage. If you have a good idea, than you are more then welcome to tell us about it.
