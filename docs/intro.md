# Start Documentation

This pages will provide you with the needed information about our Wortfokus-Website.
It is necessary to look up this documentation in case you are interested in contributing to this Project.

It will give you the general information about all the projects, or which are the sames for all the projects. As an example: we will implement a SSO-Solution, with whom we can login to all the different applications.

So since this is the same solution for all the applications, we describe it here in the general tab. For project-specific questions, please refer to the given solution.

The Idea is to have a place where you can learn about Gods word by reading written articles and also by games like a quiz with questions about the bible.
Stay tuned....
