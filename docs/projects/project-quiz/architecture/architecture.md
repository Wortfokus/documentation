# Overview

In a first step we will show up how the page is build, hosted and developed.

We have made an diagram with the tools we are using. It is possible that elements are changing over the time.
But this is the best solution for now.

There are some main ideas we use. For further information look up the provided documentations.

## Code

Our Code is hold on [Github - Wortfokus](https://github.com/Wortfokus). We have set up some Workflows and Projects, where all the Issues and Bugs are defined.

To understand how we handle the Issues and Bugs please refer to this document. _(in progress)_   
To understand the release, please refer to [this document](release-design.md).   


## Authentication

Since creating our own authentication would have been an overkill, we stick with [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/).
For further information see [this document](../../../general/authentication).   

## Full View

On this page we have a full view of all our components.
