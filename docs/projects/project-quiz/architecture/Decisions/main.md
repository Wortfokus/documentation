# Explanation

This sides provide you in a short way why some decisions where made. It is provided for you to understand the thought process when we had to make an architectural decision and selected a specific technology or some other designs.   
One example of a decision making is provided you with the next page, where we had to decide which database fits best for our solution.

Keep in mind that technology is always changing and new decisions can be made also in a later stage. It is also possible that the architect did not think about everything when he planned a specific task and therefore another solution would have been better. In that case, a new decision has to be made: Does it add so much value that we would migrate to an other technology?
