title: Architecture and Requirements

# Explanation

Like every bigger project, we try to make a short research on our needed items to fulfill the wishes of our customer.
Since this page is maintained by the author and also created, he will make the first draft of the requirements and features, we want to implement.

It will first sum again what is planned to create in this project. Afterwards we have made a list with features we want to provide. On the page [requirements](requirements.tsx) we sampled a list with the found requirements, we have to fulfill in case we want to have a little bit of a success.

On the other page [architecture](architecture.tsx) we have written a small overview of the components we will implement. Further ideas about better technologies are welcomed.
