# Startplace

Welcome to the project-pages. These pages will help you to understand the code behind our projects better and might also give you some ideas how to solve problems by yourself. (Keep in mind that the engineer behind this project is alone and has only roughly 5 years of experience).   

On this pages you can find the official documentation of the different projects and also find decision-making records. The team tried to document as much as possible. If you miss something or want to make some improvement, we are happy for any help.
