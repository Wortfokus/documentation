# Quality and Goals

There are only little quality results to be maintained.

First one is that the product can be used on any device type. (Includes first hand mobile devices and computer/laptop).

The second goal is that latency is high since users wnat to play against each others.

Third one is that the checks, which have to be included, are itself correct and used before deployment.
